If you're working with the Microsoft identity platform, you're probably familiar with the concept of application **Scopes** or **Roles**.
Scopes or Roles are used to either expose a permission in your application or to grant a permission (defined in another application) to it, e.g. grant Microsoft Graph permissions to read the user profile.

When you're [granting permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview?tabs=http) to an application, you need to understand what type of permission to grant: it can be a delegated (scope) permission or an app-only (role) one.
If this part is confusing to you, I've found this [page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts#access-scenarios) quite useful, especially the following paragraph:

> Delegated permissions, also called scopes, allow the application to act on behalf of the signed-in user. Application permissions, also called app roles, allow the app to access data on its own, without a signed-in user.

On top of understanding the differences between scope and roles, you also need to know the ID of the permission that you are interested in e.g. You want to grant **GroupMember.Read.All** to your application so you can fetch the members of a given group.

The issue I found working with these IDS is that I'm not able to find a comprehensive list of those, alongside their name and description so I decided to list them in this blog post, mostly to simplify my life when working with it.

*Actually while writing this article, I found this [page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference#all-permissions-and-ids) where the same permissions are listed, but I still find the following tables handier since they contains all the data I need.*

Besides that, I also wanted to share a tiny **az cli** command that you can use to fetch all the defined scopes and roles.

```bash
az ad sp show --id 00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000 --query "{roles: appRoles, scopes: oauth2PermissionScopes}"
```

The snippet above displays all the roles and scope defined for the Microsoft Graph application, the **00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000** is the globally unique ID of the Microsoft Graph Service principal in the Azure Active directory.

>Pro tip! If you add -o jsonc at the end of an az cli command, you will get a nice colorized json output. You can find all the output modifiers for az cli in the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/format-output-azure-cli)

## Well-known scopes

Here below you can find the list of all the well-known scopes defined by Microsoft Graph

| **Description**                               | **Id**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Type** | **Value**                                               |
